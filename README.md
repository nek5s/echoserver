# Echoserver

A simple TCP server utility written in rust.

All packets are sent in format `{id}::{metadata}::{content}`,
where metadata is `{playerCount}` (for now) and content is copied from the packet sent by the client (in my case it will be fields separated by `:`s).

This project was originally create to provide a simple server utility the Hollow Knight: Silksong mod [SilklessCoop](https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/73).

## Installation

Download the file fitting your operating system from the [Releases](https://github.com/nek5s/echoserver/releases) section.

## Usage

- Double-click the executable file
- You should now see a message like `INFO:: listening on port 45565 with the following configuration:`
- The server is now ready to start accepting incoming connections.

Note: this is intended for local testing of the mod, so it will send back your own data (you will see your own ghost)

To start the server with mirroring disabled, see [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage).

## Advanced Usage

Command-line usage: `echoserver [port] [--no-mirror] [--max-players=x] [--messages-per-second=x]`

### Parameters:

port: the network port to run the server on.

--max-players: the maximum amount of players that can connect to the server at once.

--messages-per-second: the maximum amount of messages each player can send per second.

### Flags:

--no-mirror: Disable sending packets back to the original sender.
